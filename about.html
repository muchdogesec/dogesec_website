	<p>Hi! I'm Dave, founder DOGESEC!</p>

	<p>Together, DOGESEC is a team of industry veterans building no-nonsense cyber threat intelligence tools.</p>

	<p>Our growing company is focused on the problems we want to solve and who we want to solve them for.</p>

	<p>If you are a threat intelligence analyst who wants access to tooling that will drastically improve your effectiveness, you are among friends.</p>

	<p>There are no hard sells. No marketing fluff. No vendor lock-in.</p>

	<p>We post vendor agnostic content on <a href="/blog">our blog</a> to help pass on our knowledge.</p>

	<p>We spend time addressing questions and taking part in debates on <a href="https://community.dogesec.com/" target="_blank">our community forum</a>.</p>

	<p>We publish a lot of our code under permissive open-source licenses <a href="https://github.com/muchdogesec" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p>

	<p>We offer free versions of all our products to ensure users know they are right for them (and we don't lock them into long licenses when they do become customers).</p>

	<p>The simple fact is; we build products our threat intelligence analysts love.</p>

	<p>DOGESEC is not going to change the world. DOGESEC is not going to become a billion dollar company. DOGESEC has nothing to do with crypto.</p>

	<p>Take a look around and see how we might be able to help you (<em>...no promises!</em>).</p>

	<p>-Dave, and the entire DOGESEC team.</p>
