            "name": "FireEye APT39",
            "description": "APT39: An Iranian Cyber\nEspionage Group Focused on\nPersonal Information\n\nJanuary 29, 2019\n\nSarah Hawley, Ben Read, Cristiana Brafman-Kittner, Nalani Fraser, Andrew\nThompson, Yuri Rozhansky, Sanaz Yashar\n\nOriginal report available at https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threatresearch/2019/01/apt39-iranian-cyber-espionage-group-focused-onpersonal-information.html\n\n\fIn December 2018, FireEye identified APT39 as an Iranian cyber espionage group\nresponsible for widespread theft of personal information. We have tracked activity linked to\nthis group since November 2014 in order to protect organizations from APT39 activity to\ndate. APT39\u2019s focus on the widespread theft of personal information sets it apart from\nother Iranian groups FireEye tracks, which have been linked to influence\noperations, disruptive attacks, and other threats. APT39 likely focuses on personal\ninformation to support monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations that serve Iran\u2019s\nnational priorities, or potentially to create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future\ncampaigns.\nAPT39 was created to bring together previous activities and methods used by this actor,\nand its activities largely align with a group publicly referred to as \"Chafer.\" However, there\nare differences in what has been publicly reported due to the variances in how\norganizations track activity. APT39 primarily leverages the SEAWEED and\nCACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor. While\nAPT39's targeting scope is global, its activities are concentrated in the Middle East. APT39\nhas prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel\nindustry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry. The countries and industries\ntargeted by APT39 are depicted in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Countries and industries targeted by APT39\n\n\fOperational Intent\nAPT39's focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to perform\nmonitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect\nproprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic\nrequirements related to national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors to\nfacilitate future campaigns. Government entities targeting suggests a potential secondary\nintent to collect geopolitical data that may benefit nation-state decision making. Targeting\ndata supports the belief that APT39's key mission is to track or monitor targets of interest,\ncollect personal information, including travel itineraries, and gather customer data from\ntelecommunications firms.\n\nIran Nexus Indicators\nWe have moderate confidence APT39 operations are conducted in support of Iranian\nnational interests based on regional targeting patterns focused in the Middle East,\ninfrastructure, timing, and similarities to APT34, a group that loosely aligns with activity\npublicly reported as \u201cOilRig\u201d. While APT39 and APT34 share some similarities, including\nmalware distribution methods, POWBAT backdoor use, infrastructure nomenclature, and\ntargeting overlaps, we consider APT39 to be distinct from APT34 given its use of a\ndifferent POWBAT variant. It is possible that these groups work together or share\nresources at some level.\n\nAttack Lifecycle\nAPT39 uses a variety of custom and publicly available malware and tools at all stages of\nthe attack lifecycle.\n\nInitial Compromise\nFor initial compromise, FireEye Intelligence has observed APT39 leverage spear phishing\nemails with malicious attachments and/or hyperlinks typically resulting in a POWBAT\ninfection. APT39 frequently registers and leverages domains that masquerade as\nlegitimate web services and organizations that are relevant to the intended target.\nFurthermore, this group has routinely identified and exploited vulnerable web servers of\ntargeted organizations to install web shells, such as ANTAK and ASPXSPY, and used\nstolen legitimate credentials to compromise externally facing Outlook Web Access (OWA)\nresources.\n\nEstablish Foothold, Escalate Privileges, and Internal Reconnaissance\nPost-compromise, APT39 leverages custom backdoors such as SEAWEED,\nCACHEMONEY, and a unique variant of POWBAT to establish a foothold in a target\nenvironment. During privilege escalation, freely available tools such as Mimikatz and\nNcrack have been observed, in addition to legitimate tools such as Windows Credential\nEditor and ProcDump. Internal reconnaissance has been performed using custom scripts\nand both freely available and custom tools such as the port scanner, BLUETORCH.\n\n\fLateral Movement, Maintain Presence, and Complete Mission\nAPT39 facilitates lateral movement through myriad tools such as Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP), Secure Shell (SSH), PsExec, RemCom, and xCmdSvc. Custom tools such as\nREDTRIP, PINKTRIP, and BLUETRIP have also been used to create SOCKS5 proxies\nbetween infected hosts. In addition to using RDP for lateral movement, APT39 has used\nthis protocol to maintain persistence in a victim environment. To complete its mission,\nAPT39 typically archives stolen data with compression tools such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.\n\nFigure 2: APT39 attack lifecycle\nThere are some indications that APT39 demonstrated a penchant for operational security\nto bypass detection efforts by network defenders, including the use of a modified version of\nMimikatz that was repacked to thwart anti-virus detection in one case, as well as another\ninstance when after gaining initial access APT39 performed credential harvesting outside\nof a compromised entity's environment to avoid detection.\n\nOutlook\nWe believe APT39's significant targeting of the telecommunications and travel industries\nreflects efforts to collect personal information on targets of interest and customer data for\nthe purposes of surveillance to facilitate future operations. Telecommunications firms are\nattractive targets given that they store large amounts of personal and customer\ninformation, provide access to critical infrastructure used for communications, and enable\naccess to a wide range of potential targets across multiple verticals. APT39's targeting not\nonly represents a threat to known targeted industries, but it extends to these organizations'\nclientele, which includes a wide variety of sectors and individuals on a global scale.\nAPT39's activity showcases Iran's potential global operational reach and how it uses cyber\noperations as a low-cost and effective tool to facilitate the collection of key data on\nperceived national security threats and gain advantages against regional and global rivals.\n\n\f",

If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.\n\nScripts are likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used.
